## Procedure

1. When the page is loaded user will be presented with a 3D simulator representation of RPCG on the right frame.
2. The input parameters namely Charging Voltage(VO), Cg,Cl,Lf,Ll, No of stages(N),Rt are displayed with default values on the other frame.
3. The user can conduct the experiment with the default values,However the parameters can also be changed and the experiment performed.
4. Drag your mouse to see the impulse voltage generator testing apparatus in details. You can also zoom in it by scrolling your mouse for detail study of RPCG.
5. After completing detail study of RPCG, set the value of voltage and sphere gap
6. Click on start Experiment
7. Then click on ground switch to give supply to RPCG and you can see it in simulator
8. The Charge Capacitor button is to be clicked to charge generator capacitors.Charging time of capacitor is displayed by bar on left corner of simulator
9. The Trigger generator button is to be clicked to display the mechanism of RPCG and the fact that Breakdown has occurred is displayed.
10. After complete the process the respective graph will be shown. View the waveform carefully how waveform is changing with variation in parameters.
11. Mouse-hover on wave to see the variation of generated current with time. You can drag it or Zoom In/Zoom Out the wave form for detail study.
12. Find out Td from the wave from (how to find out front time and tail time you have to see theory part).
13. After finding Td you can compare the generated rectangular pulse wave with standard rectangular pulse wave.
